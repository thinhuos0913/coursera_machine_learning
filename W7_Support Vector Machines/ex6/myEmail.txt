Hello Tran,

Happy Tuesday!

Time for another video :)

In today's video, I cover some amazing Excel custom formatting tricks.

Custom formatting is something that allows you to show the data in a cell in a specific way (without changing the actual value in the cell)

And you can do some magical stuff with it.
In this video, I cover the following topics:
Hide All Cell Values
Hide Zeros (or replace 0's with text)
Conditional Custom Formatting (Show Text Based on Cell Value)
Showing Dates in different formats (Month name or Day name)
Show Negative Numbers in Red
Show numbers in Millions or Billions
Automatically Add Checkmark or Bullets before Text
Some of these are a bit advanced, but I have tried my best to make sure I explain them in a way that anyone can understand.

I am sure you will pick up some good tricks that you can use in your work.
I hope you find today's tutorial useful.

Have a good week!
